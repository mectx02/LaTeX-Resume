\textbf{Employer --- Position} \textbar\ Location, Place 
\hfill \textsl{(Date hired -- Date of leave)} 
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item You can put things about your employer here for emphasis on how good 
          of a job you did. The lines can be as long as you want, really, but 
          try not to do more than around two lines of info per item or else it 
          looks horrible. Filler for context.
\end{itemize}
